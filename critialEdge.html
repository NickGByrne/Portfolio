	<h1> Critical Edge Radio Show at Emily Carr's CRIT Radio</h1>
	
	<div class="section">
	<h4> Role: Host, Audio Engineer </h4>
	<h4> Project for: College Radio Program</h4>
	<h4> Team members: Fernando Ortega </h4>
	</div>	
		
	<p class="text"> Critical Edge was a radio show I produced along with my co producer Fernando Ortega at Emily Carr University’s CRIT radio station. Our goals was to create an arts focused news and informational program, with interviews and up to date information on arts events in the area. We were able to get two episodes with two interviews together before the program was closed down due to my transferring to another university (SFU). </p>

	<h3> Episode 1 Jeff Pepper From CG Spectrum</h3>
		
		<audio controls>
			<source src="projects/radio/CriticalEdge01-JeffPepperInterview.wav" type = "audio/wav">
		</audio>
		
	<p class="text">The first episode was hosted as a simple interview with a guest arranged by Fernando Ortega. Jeff Pepper was the founder of the online school CG spectrum, a school which Ortega was attending. Ortega interviewed our guest at the central library. My role for this episode was audio engineer and recorder. For this episode I mainly removed stutters, and awkward pauses from the original interview using pro tools, which I got quite good at by the end of the process. The episode was released online on the radio station website and then linked on our blog and facebook page. </p>

	<h3> Episode 2 Mat Andres</h3>
		
		<audio controls>
			<source src="projects/radio/crit02.mp3" type = "audio/mp3">
		</audio>
	
	<p class="text">The second episode of the series was recorded on site at a show at the then Ayden Gallery. Our guest, Matt Andres was an artist on display at the gallery. I had originally intended to do general coverage of a party taking place at the gallery, however the gallery owner Ken Lum simply arranged an interview with Andres, and this turned out to provide plenty of material for our show. Audio engineering was done by Fernando Ortega for this episode, while I hosted and performed the interview. For this episode we broadcast live and recorded an intro and material in the campus radio station studio, with mixing done on site. </p>
