		Raccoon food hunt was completed for the GMTK game jam for 2023. The theme of that years game jam was “roles reversed” and was presented as some version of a traditional game but somehow flipped on its head. We were given one week to make the game, and organized our work over Discord and Github. After some team brain storming over a concept I came up with ended up getting chosen for the game. The concept was to have a reverse bullet hell game where the player had to get hit by bullets instead of avoiding them. The story was that you played as a raccoon that had to catch food given out by people and that they would take damage if they touched any of the people. There would also be neural enemies that would steal your food, and which you would have to chase away.

		While our other team developers came up with the core actors in the game, I was asked to come up wit code and art for a scrolling background for the game. The code I made for the scrolling background ended up being replaced, however the background was used in the game. I then made a death screen for when you lost. I finally volunteered to make the sound track for the game, which I produced by doing several passes on Garage Band. I would have liked to see some more types of feeder characters in the game that distributed food differently, and would have liked to have more specific scenarios which could act as self contained jokes, however we ran out of time to implement the game in this manor.
