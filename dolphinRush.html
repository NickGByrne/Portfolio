		<p class="text"> Dolphin Rush was created for the SFU Game Development Club’s mountain top game jam. This was an on site game jam conducted on campus in the SFU’s task building, and was held over two days. Our team however met a week before the game jam officially started, and used this time to plan out the sort of game we wanted to make. One of the team members found a game they wanted to emulate called Jetpack Joyride, and a set of whale and dolphin assets they wanted to use. The theme for the game ended up being “Peak”, and though we could have used waves and the peak of waves as our theme, I ended up suggesting that we have the a game where a dolphin swims through clouds and mountain tops, since it would be easier to model, and I thought it would look interesting. My main task was drawing a set of mountain background assets for a parallax scrolling background. I also modeled and colored a set of mountain top 3D assets which acted as obstacles. All fish assets came premade from an asset package. </p>
